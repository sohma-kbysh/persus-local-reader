# Plato Apology Local Reader

Local reading environment for Plato's *Apology* using openly distributed Perseus data.

## For Readers

On macOS, double-click:

```text
Open Plato Apology.command
```

It starts the local reader and opens your browser.

When you are done, double-click:

```text
Close Plato Apology.command
```

If macOS asks whether the file may run, choose to open it. The reader runs only
on your own computer at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## What is local now

- The Greek text is stored locally in `app/data/apology.json`.
- The generated reader in `app/index.html` works as a static local page.
- Clicking a Greek word opens a local "morph" panel.
- `scripts/fetch_morph.py` can cache Perseus Hopper morph pages for only the
  word forms that appear in the Apology.

The morph panel first uses `app/data/morph.json` when a cached Perseus analysis
is available. Otherwise it falls back to normalized forms and local lemma
candidates from `hib_lemmas.sql`.

## Local App Files

Double-click:

```text
Open Plato Apology.app
```

It starts the local reader in the background and opens the browser.

When you are done, double-click:

```text
Close Plato Apology.app
```

The other `.app` files in this folder are build leftovers and can be ignored.

The local reader also stops itself automatically after about 8 hours without
access, so forgetting to use the close app is usually fine.

## Terminal

```sh
python3 scripts/server.py 8000
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/
```

## Fetch Perseus Morph Data

The official `hib_parses.tar.gz` download repeatedly terminated early from this
network, so this project uses a resumable, Apology-only cache of Hopper's morph
pages instead.

Fetch the first 20 word forms in reading order:

```sh
python3 scripts/fetch_morph.py --limit 20 --delay 2.0
```

Continue toward all Apology word forms:

```sh
python3 scripts/fetch_morph.py --delay 2.0
```

When the reader is served with `scripts/server.py`, clicking an uncached word
fetches just that word form on demand and writes it to `app/data/morph.json`.

Perseus may return `429 Too Many Requests`; the batch script waits and retries.
The ad hoc click handler reports the 429 and lets you retry later. Both paths
write `app/data/morph.json`, so it is safe to stop and resume.
